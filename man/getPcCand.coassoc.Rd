\title{Retrieve Literature Co-associations via PubChem}
\usage{
getPcCand.coassoc(query, query_type, file_name="", timeout=30, test=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{Input identifier, either a CID, MeSH ID or Gene symbol (as string) to search}

\item{query_type}{Type of query. Accepted are currently \code{"ChemicalNeighbor"},
\code{"ChemicalGeneSymbolNeighbor"}, \code{"ChemicalDiseaseNeighbor"},
\code{"GeneSymbolChemicalNeighbor"} or \code{"DiseaseChemicalNeighbor"}.}

\item{file_name}{File name for the CSV output. If empty, this is auto-created 
based on \code{query_type} and \code{query} and will overwrite existing files
of the same name.}

\item{timeout}{The timeout, in seconds.}

\item{test}{Default \code{FALSE} is fine for all query types except 
\code{"DiseaseChemicalNeighbor"} which should be \code{TRUE}. NOTE
that this comes without any guarantee of continuous functionality}
}
\value{
File name of a 4-column CSV containing the coassociated identifier, 
name, article count and co-occurrence score. Header varies with query type.
}
\description{
Retrieves the various types of literature co-associations from  
PubChem using display download. NOTE many results are truncated and 
functionality is preliminary. Thanks to Paul Thiessen, Leonid Zaslavsky 
and Evan Bolton from PubChem team for assistance.
}
\details{
PubChem have a range of literature co-association data that may be useful
for identification purposes, see for example  
\url{https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2256#section=Chemical-Co-Occurrences-in-Literature}.
This function enables you to retrieve identifiers, names, article counts and 
the co-occurrence score for several cases, leveraging the current display format. 
NOTE that as the display may change, this function may break without warning; 
in which case please post an issue to 
\url{https://github.com/schymane/RChemMass/issues}.

Current cases accepted are: 
ChemicalNeighbor, ChemicalGeneSymbolNeighbor, ChemicalDiseaseNeighbor, 
GeneSymbolChemicalNeighbor and DiseaseChemicalNeighbor.

Available but not yet implemented (possible upon request) are 
Gene-Disease, Disease-Gene, Gene-Gene and Disease-Disease co-associations, 
as these do not directly involve chemicals.

Functions that work off the full dataset (i.e. are not truncated) are in progress.

\examples{
# Chemical-Chemical co-associations (truncated at 25)
getPcCand.coassoc(query = '2256',query_type = 'ChemicalNeighbor')
# Chemical-Gene co-associations (truncated at 100)
getPcCand.coassoc(query = '2256',query_type = 'ChemicalGeneSymbolNeighbor')
# Chemical-Disease co-associations (truncated at 25)
getPcCand.coassoc(query = '2256',query_type = 'ChemicalDiseaseNeighbor')
# Gene-Chemical co-associations (truncated at 25)
getPcCand.coassoc(query = 'CLN3',query_type = 'GeneSymbolChemicalNeighbor')
Disease-Chemical co-associations (test=TRUE only; may break at any time)
getPcCand.coassoc(query = 'C000657245',query_type = 'DiseaseChemicalNeighbor', 
test=TRUE)
